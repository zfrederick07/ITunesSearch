ITunesSearch

  .NET Core web application that allows the user to search the iTunes API for a certain album, video, or app. The user can 
search by a keyword and then sort the results by artist name, collection name, track name, or kind of result. The user can 
then select the track they want and it will take them to the iTunes so they can download it. The server will record each 
click by the user and save the information for later use.
